# hosts_monitoring
This code uses the os and time modules to ping a list of hostnames every specified interval.

# If a hostname responds to the ping, it prints that the hostname is up. If not, it prints that the hostname is down. You can modify the hostnames list with the list of hosts you want to monitor, and change the interval variable to set the number of seconds between each check. Note that this is just a simple example and there are many more advanced network monitoring tools and libraries available in Python.

# usage
``python3 nmt.py``
